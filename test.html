        <p class="wrapper__tips__carosel__name mt-47">Do:</p>

          <p>
            Relax. Breathe. Find your happy place. Think about a basket full of
            kittens. Pretend you’re on a beach sipping a Mai Tai. The more
            <b>relaxed</b> you are, the better your waxing experience will be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tell your wax specialist about any <b>medications</b> you're taking,
            like antibiotics, accutane, or topical creams like retin-a, which
            might not be compatible with waxing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wear <b>comfortable cotton panties</b> to avoid irritation if it’s
            your first time receiving a bikini wax. (They don’t have to be cute,
            but hey, it couldn’t hurt!)
          </p>

        <p class="wrapper__tips__carosel__name mt-47">Don't:</p>
        <div class="wrapper__tips__carosel__1 owl-carousel owl-theme mt-40">
          <p>
            <b>Tan</b> the area you plan to wax 24 to 48 hours before
            reservation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consume alcohol or significant amounts of caffeine before your wax.
            Both can cause pores to tighten, which could make for a more
            uncomfortable experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use any <b>numbing creams</b>. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news,
            but they don't actually penetrate the skin.
